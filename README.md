# posture-detection
Detecting Sitting Posture via webcam and Improving habits with Python

## Idea

Sitting posture is an important habit to develop early and can add up over the years. My wife tells me that I have a golumn like hunch when I am coding and I wanted to improve on this. I wanted to improve my sitting posture while working on my laptop, so this project will need to achieve a few things:

1. Get access to laptop webcam
2. Develop posture and face recognition
3. Record the number of times off posture 
4. Develop a way to remind to user to rectify their posture
5. Analyze the improvements over time
